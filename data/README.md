# Database

This section contains all the data generated from MD simulations performed in this study. 
The `raw-data` directory contains all the raw/semi-processed data obtained from the MD simulations,
including the system's decriptions, the parameters calculated from their components terminal groups, and their tribological properties. 
The `splitted-data` directory is used to stored files obtained when we split the original data set into train sets and test sets. These files are used specifically to trained and evaluate models present in the main paper.
