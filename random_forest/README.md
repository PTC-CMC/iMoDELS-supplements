# Random Forest Regressor

This study utilized the random forest regressor algorithm, implemented through the [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/). This directory contains sub-directories storing the [ML models](models), the [evaluation results](predicted-results) and the [codes](src) necessary to replicate the process. 
In the [src](src) directory, there also jupyter notebook that were used to analyze and visualize the evaluation results (including those presented in the main paper)
